**PICK THE STAR (10 LINER)** is a game for two players, written in [ugBASIC](https://ugbasic.iwashere.eu) and that runs on various 8-bit home computers. This game is a arcade game for one player. The player must pick mostly the stars that descend from the top of the screen, because they give to the player the higher score. In order to have a more quick binder, you can also take the circles (but you got less points). It is a self-competiting game. This game is designed for one player.

Since it joined this competition, the game itself is modest in size, and the given source code respects strong constraints on the length of each line (category: **EXTREME-256**) and it does not rely on third party libraries. The check has been done using [UGBASIC-IDE](https://spotlessmind1975.itch.io/ugbasic-ide).
